# Durable Object memory-pressure recovery

## Production evidence

On 2026-10-01 Cloudflare logs recorded:

`Durable Object's isolate exceeded its memory limit and was reset.`

The same condition appeared in the canonical tick path and while saving heartbeat diagnostics. The world later recovered from its durable snapshot, proving that persistent state was still available, but repeated isolate resets caused long heartbeat stalls and CI failures.

## Root pressure

The runtime previously retained several representations of the same civilization at once:

- the full mutable canonical world;
- a second structured-cloned committed reader;
- a compressed canonical rollback snapshot;
- a compressed public snapshot;
- a materialized public projection during persistence.

As Citizen knowledge, plans, relationships, procedures, objects, and history grow, peak isolate memory therefore grows faster than the canonical world itself.

## Recovery model

Production now follows a single-canonical-memory model:

- `this.world` is the only full canonical object graph;
- rollback reloads the latest committed generation from Durable Object SQLite only when needed;
- no full `committedWorld` clone is retained;
- no full private compressed rollback snapshot is retained in isolate memory;
- health uses scalar committed statistics;
- WHY uses a bounded causal reader;
- history uses the already-created bounded public history;
- `/state` continues to stream a compressed public snapshot.

The public Observer projection is also bounded. Large private knowledge remains canonical and durable, but only a small recent preview is exposed to the Observer. The same rule is applied to lexicon, known-entity, possession, and relationship views.

This changes representation, not civilization state. It does not delete canonical knowledge, reset the Durable Object, rewrite Genesis, fork the world, or move the calendar backwards.
